            <h2>Littering Management Using AI</h2>
            <p>Dec 2023 - Jun 2024</p>
            <p>In this project, we are building a model with the aim of using AI to detect unauthorized garbage disposal from a moving vehicle. We are employing three YOLOv8 models for vehicle recognition, litter detection, and number plate detection of the littering vehicle, along with EasyOCR for character extraction from the detected number plate. The system will analyze video footage to identify and record instances of littering. Our goal is to create an effective solution to help enforce anti-littering laws and promote cleaner environments.</p>
            <h2>Educational Chatbot using AI</h2>
            <p>June 2023 - Aug 2023</p>
            <p>In this project, we developed a chatbot using Python and AI tools to offer information about our department. Users interact with the system through a predefined manual, which outlines the areas where the chatbot can assist in answering their queries. Leveraging advanced technologies, our chatbot serves as a knowledgeable virtual assistant, enhancing user experience and efficiency. Its intuitive design and comprehensive knowledge base ensure accurate and prompt responses to user inquiries.</p>
